Running with Nengo OCL
----------------------

If you want to run with ``nengo_ocl``:

    python run_spaun.py -d 512 --ocl --ocl_platform=1 --ocl_device=3

where:
    - the -d flag sets the dimensionality of spaun,
    - the --ocl flag tells the run script to use ocl
    - the --ocl_platform flag tells it what OCL platform to use
    - the --ocl_device flag tells it what ocl device to use on said platform
      (this flag is optional, it's used in the context creation for pyopencl)

To determine the ``ocl_platform`` and ``ocl_device`` of the device you want to
use, see ``pyopencl.create_some_context()``.

To enable OCL profiling, find where the ``nengo_ocl.Simulator`` is created
in ``run_spaun.py``, and uncomment the version that has provifiling enabled.
Also uncomment the line to print profiling.
